#A. Three Friends<br>
time limit per test1 second<br>
memory limit per test256 megabytes<br>
inputstandard input<br>
outputstandard output<br>
Three friends are going to meet each other. Initially, the first friend stays at the position x=a, the second friend stays at the position x=b and the third friend stays at the position x=c on the coordinate axis Ox.<br>
In one minute each friend independently from other friends can change the position x by 1 to the left or by 1 to the right (i.e. set x:=x−1 or x:=x+1) or even don't change it.<br>
Let's introduce the total pairwise distance — the sum of distances between each pair of friends. Let a′, b′ and c′ be the final positions of the first, the second and the third friend, correspondingly. Then the total pairwise distance is |a′−b′|+|a′−c′|+|b′−c′|, where |x| is the absolute value of x.<br>
Friends are interested in the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach if they will move optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, they want to know the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.<br>
You have to answer q independent test cases.<br>
Input<br>
The first line of the input contains one integer q (1≤q≤1000) — the number of test cases.<br>
The next q lines describe test cases. The i-th test case is given as three integers a,b and c (1≤a,b,c≤109) — initial positions of the first, second and third friend correspondingly. The positions of friends can be equal.<br>
Output<br>
For each test case print the answer on it — the minimum total pairwise distance (the minimum sum of distances between each pair of friends) if friends change their positions optimally. Each friend will move no more than once. So, more formally, you have to find the minimum total pairwise distance they can reach after one minute.<br>

#B. Snow Walking Robot<br>
time limit per test2 seconds<br>
memory limit per test256 megabytes<br>
inputstandard input<br>
outputstandard output<br>
Recently you have bought a snow walking robot and brought it home. Suppose your home is a cell (0,0) on an infinite grid.<br>
You also have the sequence of instructions of this robot. It is written as the string s consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D'. If the robot is in the cell (x,y) right now, he can move to one of the adjacent cells (depending on the current instruction).<br>
If the current instruction is 'L', then the robot can move to the left to (x−1,y);<br>
if the current instruction is 'R', then the robot can move to the right to (x+1,y);<br>
if the current instruction is 'U', then the robot can move to the top to (x,y+1);<br>
if the current instruction is 'D', then the robot can move to the bottom to (x,y−1).<br>
You've noticed the warning on the last page of the manual: if the robot visits some cell (except (0,0)) twice then it breaks.<br>
So the sequence of instructions is valid if the robot starts in the cell (0,0), performs the given instructions, visits no cell other than (0,0) two or more times and ends the path in the cell (0,0). Also cell (0,0) should be visited at most two times: at the beginning and at the end (if the path is empty then it is visited only once). For example, the following sequences of instructions are considered valid: "UD", "RL", "UUURULLDDDDLDDRRUU", and the following are considered invalid: "U" (the endpoint is not (0,0)) and "UUDD" (the cell (0,1) is visited twice).<br>
The initial sequence of instructions, however, might be not valid. You don't want your robot to break so you decided to reprogram it in the following way: you will remove some (possibly, all or none) instructions from the initial sequence of instructions, then rearrange the remaining instructions as you wish and turn on your robot to move.<br>
Your task is to remove as few instructions from the initial sequence as possible and rearrange the remaining ones so that the sequence is valid. Report the valid sequence of the maximum length you can obtain.<br>
Note that you can choose any order of remaining instructions (you don't need to minimize the number of swaps or any other similar metric).<br>
You have to answer q independent test cases.<br>
Input<br>
The first line of the input contains one integer q (1≤q≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases.<br>
The next q lines contain test cases. The i-th test case is given as the string s consisting of at least 1 and no more than 105 characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D' — the initial sequence of instructions.<br>
It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (where |s| is the length of s) does not exceed 105 over all test cases (∑|s|≤105).<br>
Output<br>
For each test case print the answer on it. In the first line print the maximum number of remaining instructions. In the second line print the valid sequence of remaining instructions t the robot has to perform. The moves are performed from left to right in the order of the printed sequence. If there are several answers, you can print any. If the answer is 0, you are allowed to print an empty line (but you can don't print it).<br>
