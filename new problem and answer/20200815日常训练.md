# D. Boboniu Chats with Du
Have you ever used the chat application QQ? Well, in a chat group of QQ, administrators can muzzle a user for days.<br>
In Boboniu's chat group, there's a person called Du Yi who likes to make fun of Boboniu every day.<br>
Du will chat in the group for n days. On the i-th day:<br>
If Du can speak, he'll make fun of Boboniu with fun factor ai. But after that, he may be muzzled depending on Boboniu's mood.<br>
Otherwise, Du won't do anything.<br>
Boboniu's mood is a constant m. On the i-th day:<br>
If Du can speak and ai>m, then Boboniu will be angry and muzzle him for d days, which means that Du won't be able to speak on the i+1,i+2,⋯,min(i+d,n)-th days.<br>
Otherwise, Boboniu won't do anything.<br>
The total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak.<br>
Du asked you to find the maximum total fun factor among all possible permutations of a.<br>
Input<br>
The first line contains three integers n, d and m (1≤d≤n≤105,0≤m≤109).
The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109).<br>
Output<br>
Print one integer: the maximum total fun factor among all permutations of a.<br>
Examples<br>
input<br>
```
5 2 11
8 10 15 23 5
```
output<br>
```
48
```
input<br>
```
20 2 16
20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7
```
output<br>
```
195
```
Note<br>
In the first example, you can set a′=[15,5,8,10,23]. Then Du's chatting record will be:<br>
Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor 15.<br>
Be muzzled.<br>
Be muzzled.<br>
Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor 10.<br>
Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor 23.<br>
Thus the total fun factor is 48.<br>

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)

    sort(a+1, a+n+1);
    int mid = lower_bound(a+1, a+n+1, m+1) - a;
    for(int i = 1; i < mid; i++)
        prefix[i] = a[i] + prefix[i-1];
    res = prefix[mid-1];
    ll postfix = 0ll;
    for(int l_cnt=0; (n-l_cnt)>=mid&&l_cnt*(d+1)<=(n-1); l_cnt++){
        int remain = n-mid-l_cnt;
        postfix += a[n-l_cnt];
        int lower = min(mid-1, max(0,l_cnt*d-remain));
        res = max(res,postfix+(prefix[mid-1]-prefix[lower]));
    }
    printf("%lld\n",res);
    return 0;
}
