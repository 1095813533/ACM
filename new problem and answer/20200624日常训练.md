Lee is going to fashionably decorate his house for a party, using some regular convex polygons...<br>

Lee thinks a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful if and only if he can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same time.<br>

Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.<br>

Now he is shopping: the market has t regular polygons. For each of them print YES if it is beautiful and NO otherwise.<br>

Input<br>
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of polygons in the market.<br>

Each of the next t lines contains a single integer ni (3≤ni≤109): it means that the i-th polygon is a regular ni-sided polygon.<br>

Output<br>
For each polygon, print YES if it's beautiful or NO otherwise (case insensitive).<br>

Example<br>
```
4
3
4
12
1000000000
```
output<br>
```
NO
YES
YES
YES
```
Note
In the example, there are 4 polygons in the market. It's easy to see that an equilateral triangle (a regular 3-sided polygon) is not beautiful, a square (a regular 4-sided polygon) is beautiful and a regular 12-sided polygon (is shown below) is beautiful as well.

Lee was cleaning his house for the party when he found a messy string under the carpets. Now he'd like to make it clean accurately and in a stylish way...<br>
The string s he found is a binary string of length n (i. e. string consists only of 0-s and 1-s).<br>
In one move he can choose two consecutive characters si and si+1, and if si is 1 and si+1 is 0, he can erase exactly one of them (he can choose which one to erase but he can't erase both characters simultaneously). The string shrinks after erasing.<br>

Lee can make an arbitrary number of moves (possibly zero) and he'd like to make the string s as clean as possible. He thinks for two different strings x and y, the shorter string is cleaner, and if they are the same length, then the lexicographically smaller string is cleaner.<br>

Now you should answer t test cases: for the i-th test case, print the cleanest possible string that Lee can get by doing some number of moves.<br>

Small reminder: if we have two strings x and y of the same length then x is lexicographically smaller than y if there is a position i such that x1=y1, x2=y2,..., xi−1=yi−1 and xi < yi.<br>

Input<br>
The first line contains the integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.<br>

Next 2t lines contain test cases — one per two lines.<br>

The first line of each test case contains the integer n (1≤n≤105) — the length of the string s.<br>

The second line contains the binary string s. The string s is a string of length n which consists only of zeroes and ones.<br>

It's guaranteed that sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 105.<br>

Output<br>
Print t answers — one per test case.<br>

The answer to the i-th test case is the cleanest string Lee can get after doing some number of moves (possibly zero).<br>

Example<br>
input<br>
```
5
10
0001111111
4
0101
8
11001101
10
1110000000
1
1
```
output<br>
```
0001111111
001
01
0
1
```
Note<br>
In the first test case, Lee can't perform any moves.<br>

In the second test case, Lee should erase s2.<br>

In the third test case, Lee can make moves, for example, in the following order: 11001101 → 1100101 → 110101 → 10101 → 1101 → 101 → 01.<br>


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn=1e6+10;
int main(){
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        int sw = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i] < s[i-1])sw = 0;
        }
        if(sw){
            cout << s << '\n';
            continue;
        }
        string ans;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i] == '1')break;
            ans.push_back('0');
        }
        ans.push_back('0');
        for(int i = s.size()-1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(s[i] == '0')break;
            ans.push_back('1');
        }
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
}
