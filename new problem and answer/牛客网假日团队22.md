C Chocolate Buying
Bessie and the herd love chocolate so Farmer John is buying them some.
The Bovine Chocolate Store features N (1 <= N <= 100,000) kinds of chocolate in essentially unlimited quantities. Each type i of chocolate has price P_iP 
i
​	
  (1 <= P_iP 
i
​	
  <= 10^{18}10 
18
 ) per piece and there are C_iC 
i
​	
  (1 <= C_iC 
i
​	
  <= 10^{18}10 
18
 ) cows that want that type of chocolate.
Farmer John has a budget of B (1 <= B <= 10^{18}10 
18
 ) that he can spend on chocolates for the cows. What is the maximum number of cows that he can satisfy? All cows only want one type of chocolate, and will be satisfied only by that type.
Consider an example where FJ has 50 to spend on 5 different types of chocolate. A total of eleven cows have various chocolate preferences:

    Chocolate_Type    Per_Chocolate_Cost    Cows_preferring_this_type
          1                   5                      3
          2                   1                      1
          3                  10                      4
          4                   7                      2
          5                  60                      1
Obviously, FJ can't purchase chocolate type 5, since he doesn't have enough money. Even if it cost only 50, it's a counterproductive purchase since only one cow would be satisfied.
Looking at the chocolates start at the less expensive ones, he can
  * purchase 1 chocolate of type #2 for 1 x  1 leaving 50- 1=49, then
  * purchase 3 chocolate of type #1 for 3 x  5 leaving 49-15=34, then
  * purchase 2 chocolate of type #4 for 2 x  7 leaving 34-14=20, then
  * purchase 2 chocolate of type #3 for 2 x 10 leaving 20-20= 0.
He would thus satisfy 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8 cows.

输入描述:
* Line 1: Two space separated integers: N and B
* Lines 2..N+1: Line i contains two space separated integers defining chocolate type i: P_iP 
i
​	
  and C_iC 
i
​	
 
输出描述:
* Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum number of cows that Farmer John can satisfy

F 数字反转
题目描述 
给定一个整数，请将该数各个位上数字反转得到一个新数。新数也应满足整数的常见形式，即除非给定的原数为零，否则反转后得到的新数的最高位数字不应为零（参见样例2）。
输入描述:
一个整数 N。
输出描述:
一个整数，表示反转后的新数。
