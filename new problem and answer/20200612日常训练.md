Find the minimum area of a square land on which you can place two identical rectangular a×b houses. The sides of the houses should be parallel to the sides of the desired square land.

Formally,

You are given two identical rectangles with side lengths a and b (1≤a,b≤100) — positive integers (you are given just the sizes, but not their positions).
Find the square of the minimum area that contains both given rectangles. Rectangles can be rotated (both or just one), moved, but the sides of the rectangles should be parallel to the sides of the desired square.
Two rectangles can touch each other (side or corner), but cannot intersect. Rectangles can also touch the sides of the square but must be completely inside it. You can rotate the rectangles. Take a look at the examples for a better understanding.

The picture shows a square that contains red and green rectangles.
Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤10000) —the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing two integers a, b (1≤a,b≤100) — side lengths of the rectangles.

Output
Print t answers to the test cases. Each answer must be a single integer — minimal area of square land, that contains two rectangles with dimensions a×b.

B. Honest Coach

outputstandard output
There are n athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete — the athlete number i has the strength si.

You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team.

You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams A and B so that the value |max(A)−min(B)| is as small as possible, where max(A) is the maximum strength of an athlete from team A, and min(B) is the minimum strength of an athlete from team B.

For example, if n=5 and the strength of the athletes is s=[3,1,2,6,4], then one of the possible split into teams is:

first team: A=[1,2,4],
second team: B=[3,6].
In this case, the value |max(A)−min(B)| will be equal to |4−3|=1. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams.

Print the minimum value |max(A)−min(B)|.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains positive integer n (2≤n≤50) — number of athletes.

The second line contains n positive integers s1,s2,…,sn (1≤si≤1000), where si — is the strength of the i-th athlete. Please note that s values may not be distinct.

Output
For each test case print one integer — the minimum value of |max(A)−min(B)| with the optimal split of all athletes into two teams. Each of the athletes must be a member of exactly one of the two teams.

C. Similar Pairs

inputstandard input
outputstandard output
We call two numbers x and y similar if they have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by 2), or if |x−y|=1. For example, in each of the pairs (2,6), (4,3), (11,7), the numbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs (1,4), (3,12), they are not.

You are given an array a of n (n is even) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

For example, for the array a=[11,14,16,12], there is a partition into pairs (11,12) and (14,16). The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ by one, and in the second pair because they are both even.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains an even positive integer n (2≤n≤50) — length of array a.

The second line contains n positive integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100).

Output
For each test case print:

YES if the such a partition exists,
NO otherwise.
The letters in the words YES and NO can be displayed in any case.

Polycarp wants to buy exactly n shovels. The shop sells packages with shovels. The store has k types of packages: the package of the i-th type consists of exactly i shovels (1≤i≤k). The store has an infinite number of packages of each type.

Polycarp wants to choose one type of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly n shovels?

For example, if n=8 and k=7, then Polycarp will buy 2 packages of 4 shovels.

Help Polycarp find the minimum number of packages that he needs to buy, given that he:

will buy exactly n shovels in total;
the sizes of all packages he will buy are all the same and the number of shovels in each package is an integer from 1 to k, inclusive.
Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then, t test cases follow, one per line.

Each test case consists of two positive integers n (1≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤109) — the number of shovels and the number of types of packages.

Output
Print t answers to the test cases. Each answer is a positive integer — the minimum number of packages.

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 shovels — 8 packages of one shovel.

In the third test case, you need to buy a 1 package of 6 shovels.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int main() {
    int t; cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
        if (k >= n) cout << 1 << endl;
        else {
            int x = sqrt(n);
            int ans = n;
            for (int i = 2; i <= x; ++i) {
                if (n % i == 0) {
                    if (k >= i) ans = min(ans,n/i);
                    if (k >= n/i) ans = min(ans,i);
                }

E. Polygon
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Polygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side n, initially filled with the character 0.

On the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly 2n cannons were placed.

Initial polygon for n=4.
Cannons shoot character 1. At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a 1 flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another 1. After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a look at the examples for better understanding.

More formally:

if a cannon stands in the row i, to the left of the first column, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell (i,1) and ends in some cell (i,j);
if a cannon stands in the column j, above the first row, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell (1,j) and ends in some cell (i,j).
For example, consider the following sequence of shots:


1. Shoot the cannon in the row 2.                         2. Shoot the cannon in the row 2.                         3. Shoot the cannon in column 3.

You have a report from the military training on your desk. This report is a square matrix with side length n consisting of 0 and 1. You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?

Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains 0.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n (1≤n≤50) — the size of the polygon.

This is followed by n lines of length n, consisting of 0 and 1 — the polygon matrix after the training.

The total area of the matrices in all test cases in one test does not exceed 105.

Output
For each test case print:

YES if there is a sequence of shots leading to a given matrix;
NO if such a sequence does not exist.
The letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case.

You are given n strings a1,a2,…,an: all of them have the same length m. The strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Find any string s of length m such that each of the given n strings differs from s in at most one position. Formally, for each given string ai, there is no more than one position j such that ai[j]≠s[j].

Note that the desired string s may be equal to one of the given strings ai, or it may differ from all the given strings.

For example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing two positive integers n (1≤n≤10) and m (1≤m≤10) — the number of strings and their length.

Then follow n strings ai, one per line. Each of them has length m and consists of lowercase English letters.

Output
Print t answers to the test cases. Each answer (if it exists) is a string of length m consisting of lowercase English letters. If there are several answers, print any of them. If the answer does not exist, print "-1" ("minus one", without quotes).
