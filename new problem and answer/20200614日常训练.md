For some binary string s (i.e. each character si is either '0' or '1'), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length 2 were written. For each pair (substring of length 2), the number of '1' (ones) in it was calculated.

You are given three numbers:

n0 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 0;
n1 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 1;
n2 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 2.
For example, for the string s="1110011110", the following substrings would be written: "11", "11", "10", "00", "01", "11", "11", "11", "10". Thus, n0=1, n1=3, n2=5.

Your task is to restore any suitable binary string s from the given values n0,n1,n2. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers n0,n1,n2 is greater than 0. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line which contains three integers n0,n1,n2 (0≤n0,n1,n2≤100; n0+n1+n2>0). It is guaranteed that the answer for given n0,n1,n2 exists.

Output
Print t lines. Each of the lines should contain a binary string corresponding to a test case. If there are several possible solutions, print any of them.

			}
			else {

			}
			continue;
		}
		string ans;
		for (int i = 0; i < n1 + 1; ++i) {

			else ans += "1";

A permutation of length n is an array p=[p1,p2,…,pn], which contains every integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. For example, p=[3,1,4,2,5] is a permutation of length 5.

For a given number n (n≥2), find a permutation p in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between 2 and 4, inclusive. Formally, find such permutation p that 2≤|pi−pi+1|≤4 for each i (1≤i<n).

Print any such permutation for the given integer n or determine that it does not exist.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is described by a single line containing an integer n (2≤n≤1000).

Output
Print t lines. Print a permutation that meets the given requirements. If there are several such permutations, then print any of them. If no such permutation exists, print -1.
