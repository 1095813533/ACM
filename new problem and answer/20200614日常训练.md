#A. Sum of Round Numbers
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90. The following numbers are not round: 110, 707, 222, 1001.

You are given a positive integer n (1≤n≤104). Represent the number n as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number n as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing an integer n (1≤n≤104).

Output
Print t answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer k — the minimum number of summands. Next, k terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is n. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.

#E. Special Elements
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test64 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Pay attention to the non-standard memory limit in this problem.

In order to cut off efficient solutions from inefficient ones in this problem, the time limit is rather strict. Prefer to use compiled statically typed languages (e.g. C++). If you use Python, then submit solutions on PyPy. Try to write an efficient solution.

The array a=[a1,a2,…,an] (1≤ai≤n) is given. Its element ai is called special if there exists a pair of indices l and r (1≤l<r≤n) such that ai=al+al+1+…+ar. In other words, an element is called special if it can be represented as the sum of two or more consecutive elements of an array (no matter if they are special or not).

Print the number of special elements of the given array a.

For example, if n=9 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5], then the answer is 5:

a3=4 is a special element, since a3=4=a1+a2=3+1;
a5=5 is a special element, since a5=5=a2+a3=1+4;
a6=9 is a special element, since a6=9=a1+a2+a3+a4=3+1+4+1;
a8=6 is a special element, since a8=6=a2+a3+a4=1+4+1;
a9=5 is a special element, since a9=5=a2+a3=1+4.
Please note that some of the elements of the array a may be equal — if several elements are equal and special, then all of them should be counted in the answer.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is given in two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤8000) — the length of the array a. The second line contains integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 8000.

Output
Print t numbers — the number of special elements for each of the given arrays.

#F. Binary String Reconstruction
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
For some binary string s (i.e. each character si is either '0' or '1'), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length 2 were written. For each pair (substring of length 2), the number of '1' (ones) in it was calculated.

You are given three numbers:

n0 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 0;
n1 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 1;
n2 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 2.
For example, for the string s="1110011110", the following substrings would be written: "11", "11", "10", "00", "01", "11", "11", "11", "10". Thus, n0=1, n1=3, n2=5.

Your task is to restore any suitable binary string s from the given values n0,n1,n2. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers n0,n1,n2 is greater than 0. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line which contains three integers n0,n1,n2 (0≤n0,n1,n2≤100; n0+n1+n2>0). It is guaranteed that the answer for given n0,n1,n2 exists.

Output
Print t lines. Each of the lines should contain a binary string corresponding to a test case. If there are several possible solutions, print any of them.

#G. Special Permutation
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
A permutation of length n is an array p=[p1,p2,…,pn], which contains every integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. For example, p=[3,1,4,2,5] is a permutation of length 5.

For a given number n (n≥2), find a permutation p in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between 2 and 4, inclusive. Formally, find such permutation p that 2≤|pi−pi+1|≤4 for each i (1≤i<n).

Print any such permutation for the given integer n or determine that it does not exist.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is described by a single line containing an integer n (2≤n≤1000).

Output
Print t lines. Print a permutation that meets the given requirements. If there are several such permutations, then print any of them. If no such permutation exists, print -1.
