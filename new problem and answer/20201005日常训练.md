题目描述<br>
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., ak where the diﬀerence of consecutive members ai+1−ai is a constant (1 ≤ i ≤ k−1). For example, the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 is an arithmetic progression of length 5 with the common diﬀerence 3.<br>
In this problem, you are requested to ﬁnd the longest arithmetic progression which can be formed selecting some numbers from a given set of numbers. For example, if the given set of numbers is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9}, you can form arithmetic progressions such as 0, 3, 6, 9 with the common diﬀerence 3, or 9, 5, 1 with the common diﬀerence −4. In this case, the progressions 0, 3, 6, 9 and 9, 6, 3, 0 are the longest.<br>
输入描述:<br>
The input consists of a single test case of the following format.<br>
n
v1v2⋅⋅⋅vn
n is the number of elements of the set, which is an integer satisfying 2 \leq n \leq 50002≤n≤5000. Each vi(1≤i≤n) is an element of the set, which is an integer satisfying 0≤vi≤10^9. v's are all diﬀerent,<br>
输出描述:<br>
Output the length of the longest arithmetic progressions which can be formed selecting some numbers from the given set of numbers.<br>
